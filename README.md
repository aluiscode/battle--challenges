# Music
## Challenge
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of 3, instead of the number, print “Music”. For multiples of 5 print
“TI”. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print “Musical”. But here's the catch: you can use only one `if`. No multiple branches, ternary
operators or `else`.

## Requirements
- 1 `if`
- You can't use `else`, `else if` or ternary

## Install and prove
```js
  npm run i
  npm run start
```

## Testing
```js
  npm t
  npm test:coverage
```
